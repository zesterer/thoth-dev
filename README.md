# Binix

A unix-like operating system worthy of the bin.

## Objectives

The project has the following objectives...

- To create a lightweight multi-platform monolithic kernel
- To create a user-space environment for guest programs
- To create a user-space interface to the OS in the style of Unix/POSIX
- To create a robust set of drivers for commonly used hardware

## Why?

This operating system is not designed for real-world use. It exists only as a way through which I may become more familiar with OS development.

## Getting a copy

## Building

## Running

## Credits

- A lot of people on IRC, most notably 'sortie' on #osdev (irc.freenode.net)
