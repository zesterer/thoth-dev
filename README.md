# Binix

A unix-like operating system worthy of the bin.

## Objectives

The project has the following objectives...

- To create a lightweight multi-platform kernel
- To create a user-space environment for guest programs
- To create a user-space interface to the OS in the style of Unix
- To create a set of drivers for commonly used hardware

## Why?

This operating system is not designed for real-world use. It exists only as a way through which I may become more familiar with OS development.
